### ACMS60890_SP25_Final_Project â€” Data-Driven Energy Forecasting for Smart Homes
#### This project explores a data-driven framework for forecasting appliance-level energy usage in smart homes using sensor and environmental data.
#### Two modeling approaches are developed:
#### - White-box models based on interpretable physical features
#### - Hybrid models that enhance white-box predictions using sparse Gaussian process regression (SGPR) to capture nonlinear residual patterns
#### The goal is to improve prediction accuracy while preserving model interpretability. Accurate energy forecasting can enable smarter scheduling, anomaly detection, and adaptive energy control in modern smart homes.
